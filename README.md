## Data Sources
[Denver B-cycle](https://Denver.bcycle.com/) - The Trips dataset was retrieved from [Data and Reports](https://Denver.bcycle.com/data-reports).

Distances between Checkout and Return Kiosks: Distances were retrieved from [Google Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/) using Python 3.6 script.

Weather Data: Retrieved from [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) using Python 2.7 scripts.

Geo-spatial Mapping: [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/) was used to map the number of bike checkouts and returns by kiosks.

## Analysis Software
All data analyses were done in Python and with publicly available libraries using Jupyter Notebook and IDLE except for the geo-spatial mapping of the number of bike checkouts and returns by kiosks which was done using Tableau.
