<p><a href="https://denver.bcycle.com/">Denver B-cycle</a> is a non-profit public bike sharing organization operating an automated bike sharing system called Denver B-cycle. Its mission is to &quot;serve as a catalyst to fundamentally transform public thinking and behavior by operating a bike sharing system in Denver to enhance mobility while promoting all aspects of sustainability: quality of life, equity, the environment, economic development, and public health&quot;. <img src="https://github.com/hbhasin/Denver-2017-Bike-Share/blob/master/figures/Denver%20Bikes.PNG" /></p>
<p>Denver B-cycle posts its trips data set on its website as soon as its annual report is released. Trips data have been available since 2010. The 2017 annual report and its associated dataset for this report were obtained from <a href="https://denver.bcycle.com/">Denver B-Cycle website</a>.</p>
<div class="figure", align="center"><img src="figures/Denver%202017%20Annual%20Report.PNG"/></div>
<p>This study has two parts: 1. Explore the Trips datasets and visualize the data to provide useful and interesting information. 2. Deploy a variety of regression models to train and test the data followed by a prediction on 10 unseen samples.</p>
<h1 id="part-1-data-exploration">Part 1: Data Exploration</h1>
<h2 id="data-acquisition">Data Acquisition</h2>
<p>Data for this study was downloaded from several sources and combined using the following steps: 1. Downloaded B-cycle 2017 Trips and Kiosk data from <a href="https://www.denverbcycle.com/company">Denver B-Cycle website</a>. The columns names were changed to comply with Python code best practices. 2. Created a list of the 7921 combinations of the 89 checkout/return kiosks. Used <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/">Google Distance Matrix API</a> to provide the bicycling distance and time between each checkout and return kiosk. Adopted Tyler’s method of finding the average distance by taking the distance from each checkout-return pair’s distance separately then averaging it. As he pointed out in his study, this approach was taken “because of the large number of one-way streets in the Denver downtown area where the kiosks are highly clustered”. Google only supports a maximum of 2500 requests a day, it took four days to obtain this data. 3. Obtained daily and hourly weather data via <a href="https://darksky.net/dev/">Dark Sky API</a> for all of 2017. Dark Sky supports up to 1000 requests per day</p>

<p>Over 1.16% of the Denver B-cycle rides (4029 rides) had the same checkout station as return station with a trip duration of only 1 minute (Figure 1). It is very likely that the majority of these “rides” are likely people checking out a bike, and then deciding after a very short time that this particular bike doesn’t work for them.</p>

FIGURE 1: TRIP DURATION WHEN CHECKOUT AND RETURN KIOSKS ARE THE SAME
</p>
<p>There were 17,342 rows in the Trips dataset that had kiosk names not listed in the Kiosk Master List. These 17,342 rows were removed accordingly.</p>
<p>Removing the 4,029 rows with a trip duration of 1 minute and 17,342 rows with invalid kiosk names resulted in <strong>322,082 Denver B-cycle rides in 2017</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="distance-traveled">Distance Traveled</h3>
<p>To estimate the distance between checkout and return kiosks when they are the same, using the “average speed of all the other rides (nominal distance ridden divided by the duration), and then applying this average speed to the same-kiosk trip durations” was adopted. This resulted in <strong>535,628 miles ridden in 2017</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="ridership-by-calendar-and-clock-variables">Ridership by Calendar and Clock Variables</h2>
<h3 id="ridership-by-hour">Ridership by Hour</h3>
<p>Bike checkout time is probably the most important attribute in the Trips dataset. Each checkout time was converted into its integer hour. For example, 7:02 AM or 7:59 AM would be converted to an integer of 7. In this way, total number of checkouts could be aggregated for the year and plotted against their hours of the day, as shown in Figure 5.</p>
<p>It appears that the highest number of checkouts occur between 4 PM and 5 PM with ridership increasing steadily from 10 AM onwards.</p>

FIGURE 8: TOTAL CHECKOUTS BY MONTH IN 2017

<h2 id="merging-with-weather">Merging with Weather</h2>
<p>It is highly likely that weather plays a very important role in bike ridership and bike checkout times. This was shown in the previous plots on total checkouts per hour of the day, by weekday, and by month. To verify this, weather data obtained from Dark Sky API was merged with the Trips dataset and several graphs plotted to visualize the relationships.</p>
<h3 id="checkouts-vs.-daily-temperature">Checkouts vs. Daily Temperature</h3>
<p>Figure 9 shows the total number of checkouts against maximum and minimum daily temperature. It clearly suggests that ridership increases as the temperature increases and vice-versa.</p>

</div>
<p align="center">
FIGURE 9: TOTAL CHECKOUTS BY DAILY TEMPERATURE IN 2017
</p>
<p>Apparent temperature, as defined by Dark Sky, is “apparent (or “feels like”) temperature in degrees Fahrenheit”. It appears to have a subtle effect on bike ridership as shown in Figure 10.</p>

<h2 id="checkouts-vs.-daily-cloud-cover">Checkouts vs. Daily Cloud Cover</h2>
<p>Dark Sky defines Cloud Cover as “the percentage of sky occluded by clouds, between 0 and 1, inclusive”. Figures 11 shows the total number of checkouts against daily cloud cover. They clearly suggest that ridership is highest as the cloud cover stays at around 0.15.</p>

<p>Wind speed is reported in miles per hour. As shown in Figure 12, ridership does not seem to be somewhat impacted by higher wind speeds.</p>

<h2 id="days-with-highestlowest-ridership">Days with Highest/Lowest Ridership</h2>
<p>Another interesting data discovery was the fact that Saturdays and Sundays had the highest and lowest ridership depending upon the weather. In his study, Tyler suggests that this may be due to “‘weekend warriors’ who rent B-cycles for pleasure and are highly affected by the weather in their decision to ride”. This may well be the case.</p>

<h1 id="part-2-regression-modeling">Part 2: Regression Modeling</h1>
<p>In this section various linear and non-linear regression models were used to test and train the Trips data that was merged with the weather data to try to predict the number of checkouts based on calendar, clock and weather conditions.</p>
<p>The following regression models with their brief explanation were used in this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear Regression</li>
<li><p>Most widely used statistical and machine learning technique to model relationship between two sets of variables typically using a straight line. Simple to use and fast performance but lacks high accuracy when compared to non-linear models.</p></li>
<li>Lasso Regression</li>
<li><p>A type of linear regression that uses shrinkage to reduce data values toward the mean. Well suited for automating feature selection.</p></li>
<li>Ridge Regression</li>
<li><p>Well suited for data that suffers from multicollinearity, i.e. features with high correlation.</p></li>
<li>Bayesian Ridge Regression</li>
<li><p>An approach to linear regression in which the statistical analysis is undertaken using Bayesian inference.</p></li>
<li>Decision Tree Regression</li>
<li><p>Uses a tree like structure to derive a final decision on the outcome of the analysis.</p></li>
<li>Random Forest Regression</li>
<li><p>An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees to arrive at the mean prediction.</p></li>
<li>Extra Trees Regression</li>
<li><p>An extremely randomized tree regressor. Builds a totally random decision tree.</p></li>
<li>Nearest Neighbors Regression</li>
<li><p>A simple algorithm that uses a similarity measure (e.g. distance between neighbors) to predict the outcome.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="regression-modeling-with-categorical-feature-set">Regression Modeling with Categorical Feature Set</h2>
<p>The Checkout Month, Week Day and Hour numeric variables were converted to categorical features resulting in 45 total features for regression modeling.</p>
<p>Prior to applying the models a feature correlation was performed on all the features to see if any of the features were highly correlated to one another. As shown in Figure 21, Temperature and Apparent Temperature were highly correlated suggesting that one of them could be removed from the features in the model application.</p>

<p align="center">
FIGURE 21: FEATURE CORRELATIONS
</p>
<p>The models used for regression supported the use of several parameters that could be used to adjust or tune them for better performance. In most cases in this study, the parameters were set to default.</p>
<p>The dataset was randomly spilt into 70% for training and 30% for testing. For each model the training and test scores, R Squared and RMSE results were collected and summarized. In addition, the Decision Tree, Random Forest and Extra Trees models also had their Feature Importance bar charts plotted. The chart for Extra Tree model is shown in Figure 22.</p>

<li>The data exploration phase of this study revealed the significance of weather variables on the ridership. The regression modeling phase confirmed this to be accurate. Looking at the feature importance graphs generated by the Extra Trees and Random Forest models, the weather attributes rank the highest.</li>
<li>The non-linear regression models performed better than the linear models. In particular, even with a reduced feature set, the non-linear models such as the Random Forest and the Extra Trees were the best performers with R Squared values well above 0.9.</li>
